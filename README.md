Hi I am Ahmed Sidi Mohamed.

Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Mechanical Design. And on the weekends I love to play the Cello!

Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can. I am currently studying at the Higher National School of Engineering of Tunis (ENSIT).

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with companies and people that are working on projects that will help the world one idea at a time.

How to reach me, by email ahmedsidimohammed78@gmail.com.

I would like to continue to work in the engineering field and create a design that matters. So if you are interested in talking to someone about the latest physics or are looking for an employee let me know!
